# Predict-CO2-Emissions-in-Rwanda

The primary objective of this competition was to predict future carbon emissions using open-source CO2 emissions data derived from Sentinel-5P satellite observations. With the increasing concerns about climate change, accurate monitoring of carbon emissions has become paramount. While regions like Europe and North America have robust systems to monitor these emissions, Africa lacks such extensive systems. This challenge aimed to bridge this gap by leveraging machine learning models to estimate carbon emission levels across Africa, especially in areas where ground-level monitoring is challenging.

The competition utilized the GRACED dataset, courtesy of Carbon Monitor. This dataset provides valuable insights into carbon emissions, making it a vital resource for this challenge. Special acknowledgment goes to Darius Moruri from Zindi for his commendable efforts in preparing the dataset and the starter notebooks.

The starter code for this competition, which includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial modeling, can be found on Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/inversion/getting-started-eda). This code serves as a foundation for participants to understand the dataset's structure, visualize the data, and kickstart their modeling efforts.
